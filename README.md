# Crash Insight: Modeling Factors for Safer Roads
## Analytical Avengers - INFO 523 Data/Web Mining Class Project

### Project Overview
This project, "Crash Insight: Modeling Factors for Safer Roads," aims to analyze crash data provided by MassDOT through their Mass Impact tool to identify factors associated with crash severity. The objective is to gain insights into the causes of crashes and develop predictive models to enhance road safety.

### Data Information
- **Source**: Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT)
- **Description**: The dataset contains crash data reported by police officers, including various features like crash severity, road conditions, weather conditions, age of drivers, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data underwent several preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, binning age groups, and one-hot encoding categorical variables.

### Setup and Dependencies
- **Environment Requirements**: Python 3.x, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and other data-related libraries.

### Project Structure
- **Directory Layout**:
  - `data/`: Contains the crash dataset.
- **Key Files**:
  - `about.qmd`: Information about the developors.
  - `index.qmd`: Code developed for a project write up.
  - `presentation.qmd`: Presentation that was developed to discuss the key findings.
  - `proposal.qmd`: Overview of the project proposed to the professor.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python libraries.

### Results and Conclusions
- **Key Findings**: Certain variables are strongly related to crash severity, with significant data imbalance between no-injury and severe crashes.
- **Implications**: The insights gained can inform traffic safety measures and contribute to improved predictive modeling for crash prevention.
- **Next Steps**: Further research could involve addressing data imbalance, exploring additional metrics, and refining predictive models.
