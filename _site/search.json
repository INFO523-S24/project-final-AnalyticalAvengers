    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nUnderstanding the factors contributing to severe car crashes is crucial for improving road safety and reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities. This project aims to develop a predictive model that correlates age demographics with severe crashes in Massachusetts. The ultimate goal is to identify key risk factors and provide data-driven insights for implementing effective safety measures.\nOur team is analyzing a comprehensive dataset of car crashes from January 2024, collected from the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. This dataset comprises 72 dimensions, encompassing a range of variables, including crash characteristics, driver demographics, environmental conditions, and vehicle information. By examining these variables, we seek to uncover patterns that link age with severe crashes, offering valuable insights into potential high-risk groups and circumstances.\nOur analysis focuses on two main research questions: identifying the age groups most at risk for severe crashes and exploring the role of environmental factors such as lighting, weather, road conditions, and speed limits. Additionally, we aim to develop a predictive model capable of classifying crash severity based on these variables. To achieve this, we used multiple binary classification models, which are known for their simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks.\nThe methodology for our analysis involved several key steps. First, we pre-processed the dataset to handle missing data, standardize categorical variables, and scale numerical features. Next, we conducted exploratory data analysis to identify significant correlations and patterns. To predict crash severity, we trained a KNN model using a subset of the data and evaluated its performance on a separate test set. The model’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were measured to determine its effectiveness. The high accuracy achieved in the model’s predictions indicates its potential for real-world application in road safety.\nThis report details our approach to analyzing the Massachusetts crash dataset, including the steps taken to process the data, build the predictive model, and evaluate its performance. We discuss our findings and provide insights into which age groups are most at risk, along with the environmental factors that contribute to severe crashes. Through this work, we aim to contribute to road safety practices and provide useful information for policymakers, traffic safety professionals, and other stakeholders interested in reducing traffic-related incidents and enhancing public safety."

This dataset was chosen due to the relevance it holds in today’s day and age that is witness to an unfortunate increase in road accidents since the past 30 years. Analysing this data can help find patterns to create an algorithm or model that can predict crashes which could extensively assist in preventing accidents and possible deaths. By working on this data, we can contribute with identification of place/time of possible accidents that could aid in ensuring safer travel experiences for the public.\nThe dataset consists of 72 dimensions, some of which are - Crash Number, City Town/Name, Crash Date, Crash Severity, Crash Time, Crash Year, Max Injury Severity Reported, Age of Driver - Youngest Known, Age of Driver - Oldest Known etc.\nThe description of the variable can be found in README.md file."

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nAnalysis plan for Question 1\nUnderstanding who’s most likely to be in a serious crash is crucial for making our roads safer. We’ll be diving into crash data to see which age groups, for both drivers and pedestrians/cyclists, are most at risk for severe crashes (think bad injuries).\nNext, we’ll shift gears and investigate the role of the environment. We’ll see if crashes are more likely to be severe under certain conditions, like bad weather, nighttime driving, or busy roads. By pinpointing these risky situations, we can identify areas for improvement, like better lighting or stricter enforcement of speed limits.\nVariables for Question 1 : Age of Driver - Youngest Known Age of Driver - Oldest Known Age of Vulnerable User - Youngest Known Age of Vulnerable User - Oldest Known\nCrash Severity Variables: Crash Severity Max Injury Severity Reported\nOther Variables: Crash Date and Crash Time Number of Vehicles Light Conditions, Weather Conditions, Road Surface Conditions Speed Limit Vehicle Make, Vehicle Model\nVisualizations : we are going to used in this is Bar plots for Crash Severity by Age, Heatmaps for Combined Risk Factorsand for Speed and Severity we are going to use Scatter Plots\n\n\nAnalysis plan for Question 2\nTo predict the severity of crashes and classify them as dangerous or not, several machine learning (ML) methods can be effectively utilized. Each method brings its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice often depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset, the complexity of the relationships between features, and the interpretability requirements. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are the possible candidates for ML methods to implement.\nInitially, the dataset undergoes a preprocessing phase to handle missing values, encode categorical variables(all the categorical variables in our dataset), and potentially scale numerical features. The target variable, defining crash severity, is also established during this phase. The next step involves feature selection and engineering, where the most relevant features are identified to be used in model training using correlation analysis and random forest feature importance, and then the dimension reduction will be done using PCA analysis. Various ML models are then trained on a portion of the data, and their performance is evaluated using a separate test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to assess model performance. Based on these evaluations, the best-performing model is selected, tuned for optimal performance through hyperparameter optimization, and then validated to ensure its generalizability. Finally, the chosen model can be deployed to predict the severity of new crashes, providing valuable insights for safety measures and interventions."
