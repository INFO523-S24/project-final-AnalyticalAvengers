# Introduction to the dataset

# 

-   This dataset has been sourced from the official website of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.
-   The dataset is a compilation of car crash information from January 2024, Massachussets and it comprises of totally 72 dimensions.
-   Using important variables such as- Crash Number, Crash Severity, City/Town Name, Age of Driver etc. we analyze how different ages of driver can affect or play a factor in the severity of car crashes and accidents.

## Question 1:

Which age groups are at the highest risk of getting into severe crashes, and how do factors like lighting, weather, road conditions, speed limits, and the number of vehicles involved contribute to the likelihood of certain age groups being in more danger?

## Plots for question 1

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot A

![Bar Plot visualizing the Severity of car crashes across different age groups:](images/q1_plot1.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}



#### Insights

-   The plot visualizes the distribution of crashes across different age groups, categorized by crash severity (No injury, Minor Injury, etc.).

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each age group and severity level, you can identify which age groups are more likely to be involved in crashes of varying severity.

 -   the plot might show that younger or older drivers have a higher number of crashes with minor injuries compared to middle-aged drivers.

#### Plot B

![Crash Severity by Light Conditions:](images/q1_plot2.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The plot visualizes the distribution of crashes across different lighting conditions, categorized by crash severity .

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each lighting condition and severity level, you can identify lighting conditions with a higher number of crashes of varying severity.

-    the plot might show that crashes with severe injuries are more frequent under dark conditions with no lighting compared to daylight conditions.

#### Plot C

![Heatmap of Crash Severity by Age Group and Light Conditions:](images/q1_plot3.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The heatmap allows for a more nuanced analysis compared to count plots. The color intensity visually represents the proportion of crashes with different severities under varying lighting conditions for each age group.
-   You can identify trends like:
Age groups with a higher proportion of severe crashes under dark conditions compared to well-lit conditions.
Specific lighting conditions where a particular age group experiences a higher proportion of crashes of a certain severity .

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot D

![Crash Severity by Weather Conditions:](images/q1_plot4.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The plot shows the number of crashes with different severity levels (No injury, Minor Injury, etc.) under various weather conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, etc.).

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each weather condition and severity level, you can identify weather conditions with a higher number of crashes of varying severity.

## Question 2:

Is it possible to develop a model that can accurately classify the severity of crashes based on our findings from the previous question about factors that contribute to said level of danger?

## Plots for question 2

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot A


#### Insights

-   Heatmap:

Identify strong positive or negative correlations between numerical features and the target variable (crash severity, assuming it's numerical). Features with high positive correlations might influence crash severity in a similar way, while features with high negative correlations might have opposing effects.

-   Pairplot:

Visually confirm the correlation trends observed in the heatmap. The scatter plots can reveal non-linear relationships that might not be evident in the correlation matrix.
