# Introduction to the dataset

# 

-   This dataset has been sourced from the official website of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.
-   The dataset is a compilation of car crash information from January 2024, Massachussets and it comprises of totally 72 dimensions.
-   Using important variables such as- Crash Number, Crash Severity, City/Town Name, Age of Driver etc. we analyze how different ages of driver can affect or play a factor in the severity of car crashes and accidents.

## Question 1:

Which age groups are at the highest risk of getting into severe crashes, and how do factors like lighting, weather, road conditions, speed limits, and the number of vehicles involved contribute to the likelihood of certain age groups being in more danger?

## Plots for question 1

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot A

![Bar Plot visualizing the Severity of car crashes across different age groups:](images/q1_plot1.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The plot visualizes the distribution of crashes across different age groups, categorized by crash severity (No injury, Minor Injury, etc.).

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each age group and severity level, you can identify which age groups are more likely to be involved in crashes of varying severity.

 -   the plot might show that younger or older drivers have a higher number of crashes with minor injuries compared to middle-aged drivers.

#### Plot B

![Crash Severity by Light Conditions:](images/q1_plot2.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The plot visualizes the distribution of crashes across different lighting conditions, categorized by crash severity .

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each lighting condition and severity level, you can identify lighting conditions with a higher number of crashes of varying severity.

-    the plot might show that crashes with severe injuries are more frequent under dark conditions with no lighting compared to daylight conditions.

#### Plot C

![Heatmap of Crash Severity by Age Group and Light Conditions:](images/q1_plot3.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The heatmap allows for a more nuanced analysis compared to count plots. The color intensity visually represents the proportion of crashes with different severities under varying lighting conditions for each age group.
-   You can identify trends like:
Age groups with a higher proportion of severe crashes under dark conditions compared to well-lit conditions.
Specific lighting conditions where a particular age group experiences a higher proportion of crashes of a certain severity .

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot C

![Crash Severity by Weather Conditions:](images/q1_plot4.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The plot shows the number of crashes with different severity levels (No injury, Minor Injury, etc.) under various weather conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, etc.).

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each weather condition and severity level, you can identify weather conditions with a higher number of crashes of varying severity.

## Question 2:

Is it possible to develop a model that can accurately classify the severity of crashes based on our findings from the previous question about factors that contribute to said level of danger?

## Plots for question 2

# Using Quarto for presentations

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::

[^1]: And add footnotes

-   like

-   this

## Code

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Fit a linear regression model
X = mtcars[['speed']]
y = mtcars['mpg']
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Summary of the model
X2 = sm.add_constant(X)
est = sm.OLS(y, X2)
est2 = est.fit()
print(est2.summary())
```

## Plots

```{python}
penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].apply(lambda x: "Adelie" if x == "Adelie" else "Other")
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g', hue='species')
plt.show()
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 5.5
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.618))
sns.boxplot(data=penguins, x='bill_length_mm', y='species', hue='species', ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{python}
penguins.head().to_html()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
