# Introduction to the dataset

# 

-   This dataset has been sourced from the official website of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.
-   The dataset is a compilation of car crash information from January 2024, Massachussets and it comprises of totally 72 dimensions.
-   Using important variables such as- Crash Number, Crash Severity, City/Town Name, Age of Driver etc. we analyze how different ages of driver can affect or play a factor in the severity of car crashes and accidents.

## Question 1:

Which age groups are at the highest risk of getting into severe crashes, and how do factors like lighting, weather, road conditions, speed limits, and the number of vehicles involved contribute to the likelihood of certain age groups being in more danger?

## Plots for question 1

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot A

![Bar Plot visualizing the Severity of car crashes across different age groups:](images/q1_plot1.png){fig-align="center" width="660" height="450"}



#### Insights

-   The plot visualizes the distribution of crashes across different age groups, categorized by crash severity (No injury, Minor Injury, etc.).

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each age group and severity level, you can identify which age groups are more likely to be involved in crashes of varying severity.

 -   the plot might show that younger or older drivers have a higher number of crashes with minor injuries compared to middle-aged drivers.

#### Insights

-   The plot visualizes the distribution of crashes across different lighting conditions, categorized by crash severity .

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each lighting condition and severity level, you can identify lighting conditions with a higher number of crashes of varying severity.

-    the plot might show that crashes with severe injuries are more frequent under dark conditions with no lighting compared to daylight conditions.

#### Plot C

#### Insights

-   The heatmap allows for a more nuanced analysis compared to count plots. The color intensity visually represents the proportion of crashes with different severities under varying lighting conditions for each age group.
-   You can identify trends like:
Age groups with a higher proportion of severe crashes under dark conditions compared to well-lit conditions.
Specific lighting conditions where a particular age group experiences a higher proportion of crashes of a certain severity .

#### Plot D

![Crash Severity by Weather Conditions:](images/q1_plot4.png){fig-align="center" width="660"}

#### Insights

-   The plot shows the number of crashes with different severity levels (No injury, Minor Injury, etc.) under various weather conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, etc.).

-   By analyzing the height of the bars for each weather condition and severity level, you can identify weather conditions with a higher number of crashes of varying severity.

## Question 2: 

Is it possible to develop a model that can accurately classify the severity of crashes based on our findings from the previous question about factors that contribute to said level of danger?

## Model Development and Evaluation

Building on the insights from Question 1, our aim in Question 2 is to develop and evaluate predictive models that can accurately classify the severity of crashes. This section describes our approach to modeling, including data preparation, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Preparation and Feature Selection

We filtered the data to exclude rows with unknown severity and then created a binary target variable to distinguish between 'no injury' and 'injury/fatality' crashes. We focused on features identified as potentially influential, such as Speed Limit, Light Conditions, and Weather Conditions.

## Model Training

We trained four different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Each model was evaluated using a split of 80% training data and 20% testing data.

## Model Evaluation

We assessed the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we computed the ROC curves and AUC to evaluate the models' performance comprehensively.

## Visualizations for Question 2

#### Correlation Matrix and Pair Plot

#### Insights
- The correlation matrix helps identify the lack of strong linear relationships, suggesting that non-linear modeling techniques may be more effective.

#### Insights
- The pair plot provides a visual insight into the distributions and relationships of numerical features, highlighting potential outliers and trends.

#### ROC Curve
![ROC Curve for different classifiers showing their performance in classifying crash severity.](images/q2_plot2.png)

#### Insights
- The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Random Forest shows the highest AUC, indicating the best performance among the tested models in distinguishing between the crash severities.

#### Confusion Matrices for Models
![Confusion matrices for Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.](images/q2_plot3.png){fig-align="center" height="800"}

#### Insights
- The confusion matrices reveal the performance of each model in predicting the correct classes. Notably, Random Forest balanced the recall and precision better than other models, effectively managing the class imbalance.

## Discussion and Conclusions

The models developed in this study provide a foundation for predicting crash severity with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, the imbalance in the dataset poses a challenge, as models tend to predict the majority class more frequently.

## Recommendations for Future Work

- Investigate more sophisticated balancing techniques like SMOTE or targeted sampling methods.
- Explore more complex models or ensemble methods that may capture interactions between features more effectively.
- Consider integrating more contextual data that could impact crash severity, such as time of day or specific event data like traffic volume.

By addressing these areas, future research can enhance the predictive accuracy and utility of the models, ultimately contributing to more targeted and effective road safety measures.
