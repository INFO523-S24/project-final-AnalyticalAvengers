## Goal and Motivation

Our goal is to analyze how age correlates with dangerous crashes using a January 2024 crash dataset from Massachusetts, with the aim of developing a predictive model to understand and mitigate such incidents.

Investigating the relationship between age demographics and dangerous crashes holds significant importance in enhancing road safety measures and reducing the frequency of severe accidents. By delving into the January 2024 crash dataset from Massachusetts, our analysis seeks to uncover patterns and trends that can elucidate how age influences the likelihood and severity of crashes. Moreover, the development of predictive models based on this analysis offers practitioners and policymakers valuable tools for proactive decision-making and resource allocation. By accurately predicting areas and times with heightened crash risks based on age demographics, authorities can implement preemptive measures. Ultimately, our research endeavors not only contribute to the advancement of data-driven approaches in traffic safety but also hold the potential to make tangible improvements in road safety practices, benefiting both practitioners and society at large.

## Description of the Dataset:

The dataset “crash_data” that will be used for this project has been sourced from the official website of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.                                                                                                                       This dataset was chosen due to the relevance it holds in today’s day and age that is witness to an unfortunate increase in road accidents since the past 30 years. Analysing this data can help find patterns to create an algorithm or model that can predict crashes which could extensively assist in preventing accidents and possible deaths. By working on this data, we can contribute with identification of place/time of possible accidents that could aid in ensuring safer travel experiences for the public.                                                                                                                                   The dataset consists of 72 dimensions, some of which are - Crash Number, City Town/Name, Crash Date, Crash Severity, Crash Time, Crash Year, Max Injury Severity Reported, Age of Driver - Youngest Known, Age of Driver - Oldest Known etc.


## Questions

Q1 - What ages are most likely to get  into a dangerous crashes
Q2 - Can we develop a model or algorithm to predict when dangerous crashes will occur

To predict the severity of crashes and classify them as dangerous or not, several machine learning (ML) methods can be effectively utilized. Each method brings its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice often depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset, the complexity of the relationships between features, and the interpretability requirements.
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are the possible candidates for ML methods to implement.

Initially, the dataset undergoes a preprocessing phase to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and potentially scale numerical features. The target variable, defining crash severity, is also established during this phase. The next step involves feature selection, where the most relevant features are identified to be used in model training. Various ML models are then trained on a portion of the data, and their performance is evaluated using a separate test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to assess model performance. Based on these evaluations, the best-performing model is selected, tuned for optimal performance through hyperparameter optimization, and then validated to ensure its generalizability. Finally, the chosen model can be deployed to predict the severity of new crashes, providing valuable insights for safety measures and interventions.
