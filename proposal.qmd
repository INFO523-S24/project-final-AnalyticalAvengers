## Dataset

```{python}
# Read in the data
url = 'data/crash_data.csv'
crash_data = pd.read_csv(url)

# # Display dimensions of the dataset
dimensions = crash_data.shape
print(f"Dimensions of the dataset: {dimensions} \n")

# Display data types of each column
data_types = crash_data.dtypes
print(data_types)

numerical_vars = crash_data.select_dtypes(include = ['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()
categorical_vars = crash_data.select_dtypes(include = ['object', 'category']).columns.tolist()

# Display the counts of numerical and categorical variables

## Goal and Motivation

Our goal is to analyze how age correlates with dangerous crashes using a January 2024 crash dataset from Massachusetts, with the aim of developing a predictive model to understand and mitigate such incidents.

Investigating the relationship between age demographics and dangerous crashes holds significant importance in enhancing road safety measures and reducing the frequency of severe accidents. By delving into the January 2024 crash dataset from Massachusetts, our analysis seeks to uncover patterns and trends that can elucidate how age influences the likelihood and severity of crashes. Moreover, the development of predictive models based on this analysis offers practitioners and policymakers valuable tools for proactive decision-making and resource allocation. By accurately predicting areas and times with heightened crash risks based on age demographics, authorities can implement preemptive measures. Ultimately, our research endeavors not only contribute to the advancement of data-driven approaches in traffic safety but also hold the potential to make tangible improvements in road safety practices, benefiting both practitioners and society at large.


## Questions

Q1 - What ages are most likely to get  into a dangerous crashes
Q2 - Can we develop a model or algorithm to predict when dangerous crashes will occur

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).

Variables for question 1 :
Age of Driver - Youngest Known
Age of Driver - Oldest Known
Age of Vulnerable User - Youngest Known
Age of Vulnerable User - Oldest Known

Crash Severity Variables:
Crash Severity
Max Injury Severity Reported

Other Variables:
Crash Date and Crash Time 
Number of Vehicles
Light Conditions, Weather Conditions, Road Surface Conditions
Speed Limit
Vehicle Make, Vehicle Model
