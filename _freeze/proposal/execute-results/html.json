By delving into the January 2024 crash dataset from Massachusetts, our analysis seeks to uncover patterns and trends that can elucidate how age influences the likelihood and severity of crashes. Moreover, the development of predictive models based on this analysis offers practitioners and policymakers valuable tools for proactive decision-making and resource allocation. By accurately predicting areas and times with heightened crash risks based on age demographics, authorities can implement preemptive measures. Ultimately, our research endeavors not only contribute to the advancement of data-driven approaches in traffic safety but also hold the potential to make tangible improvements in road safety practices, benefiting both practitioners and society at large.\n\nHigh-Level Goals:\nAnomaly Detection in Road Safety: By identifying outliers in crash data—situations that deviate from the norm—we can pinpoint unusual patterns, such as unexpected high-risk areas for certain age groups or conditions, thereby enhancing targeted interventions.\nAssociation Rule Mining for Safety Measures: Through this technique, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between various factors (like weather conditions, time, and demographic details) contributing to severe crashes, facilitating the development of tailored preventive measures.\nInteractive Data Visualization: Developing an interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into crash data, enabling policymakers, researchers, and the public to explore and understand the nuances of road safety dynamically.\n\n## Dataset\n\n::: {#cell-initial-EDA .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Read in the data\nurl = 'data/crash_data.csv'\ncrash_data = pd.read_csv(url)\n\n# # Display dimensions of the dataset\ndimensions = crash_data.shape\nprint(f\"Dimensions of the dataset: {dimensions} \\n\")\n\n# Display data types of each column\ndata_types = crash_data.dtypes\nprint(\"Display the data types for each feature:\")\nprint(data_types)\n\nnumerical_vars = crash_data.select_dtypes(include = ['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()\ncategorical_vars = crash_data.select_dtypes(include = ['object', 'category']).columns.tolist()\n\n# Display the counts of numerical and categorical variables\nprint(f\"\\nNumber of numerical variables: {len(numerical_vars)}\")\nprint(f\"Number of categorical variables: {len(categorical_vars)}\")\nprint('\\n')\n\ncrash_data.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nDimensions of the dataset: (25550, 72) \n\nDisplay the data types for each feature:\nCrash Number       object\nCity Town Name     object\nCrash Date         object\nCrash Severity     object\nCrash Status       object\n                   ...   \nVehicle Make       object\nVehicle Model      object\nPerson Number     float64\nAge               float64\nSex                object\nLength: 72, dtype: object\n\nNumber of numerical variables: 13\nNumber of categorical variables: 59\n\n\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#initial-eda .cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Crash Number</th>\n      <th>City Town Name</th>\n      <th>Crash Date</th>\n      <th>Crash Severity</th>\n      <th>Crash Status</th>\n      <th>Crash Time</th>\n      <th>Crash Year</th>\n      <th>Max Injury Severity Reported</th>\n      <th>Number of Vehicles</th>\n      <th>Police Agency Type</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>X</th>\n      <th>Y</th>\n      <th>Latitude</th>\n      <th>Longitude</th>\n      <th>Vehicle Unit Number</th>\n      <th>Vehicle Make</th>\n      <th>Vehicle Model</th>\n      <th>Person Number</th>\n      <th>Age</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>5342297</td>\n      <td>LOWELL</td>\n      <td>01/01/2024</td>\n      <td>Non-fatal injury</td>\n      <td>Open</td>\n      <td>3:26 AM</td>\n      <td>2024.0</td>\n      <td>Possible Injury (C)</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>Local police</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>HOND</td>\n      <td>HR-V</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>32.0</td>\n      <td>F -

This dataset was chosen due to the relevance it holds in today’s day and age that is witness to an unfortunate increase in road accidents since the past 30 years. Analysing this data can help find patterns to create an algorithm or model that can predict crashes which could extensively assist in preventing accidents and possible deaths. By working on this data, we can contribute with identification of place/time of possible accidents that could aid in ensuring safer travel experiences for the public.\n\nThe dataset consists of 72 dimensions, some of which are - Crash Number, City Town/Name, Crash Date, Crash Severity, Crash Time, Crash Year, Max Injury Severity Reported, Age of Driver - Youngest Known, Age of Driver - Oldest Known etc.\n\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestion 1 - Which age groups are at the highest risk of getting into severe crashes, and how do factors like lighting, weather, road conditions, speed limits, and the number of vehicles involved contribute to the likelihood of certain age groups being in more danger? \n\nQuestion 2 - Is it possible to develop a model that can accurately classify the severity of crashes based on our findings from the previous question about factors that contribute to said level of danger?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n### Analysis plan for Question 1\n\n\nUnderstanding who's most likely to be in a serious crash is crucial for making our roads safer. We'll be diving into crash data to see which age groups, for both drivers and pedestrians/cyclists, are most at risk for severe crashes (think bad injuries).\n\nNext, we'll shift gears and investigate the role of the environment.  We'll see if crashes are more likely to be severe under certain conditions, like bad weather, nighttime driving, or busy roads. By pinpointing these risky situations, we can identify areas for improvement, like better lighting or stricter enforcement of speed limits. \n\nVariables for  Question 1 :\nAge of Driver - Youngest Known\nAge of Driver - Oldest Known\nAge of Vulnerable User - Youngest Known\nAge of Vulnerable User - Oldest Known\n\nCrash Severity Variables:\nCrash Severity\nMax Injury Severity Reported\n\nOther Variables:\nCrash Date and Crash Time \nNumber of Vehicles\nLight Conditions, Weather Conditions, Road Surface Conditions\nSpeed Limit\nVehicle Make, Vehicle Model\n\nVisualizations :  we are going to used in this is Bar plots for Crash Severity by Age, Heatmaps for Combined Risk Factorsand for Speed and Severity we are going to use Scatter Plots\n\n### Analysis plan for Question 2\n\nTo predict the severity of crashes and classify them as dangerous or not, several machine learning (ML) methods can be effectively utilized. Each method brings its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice often depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset, the complexity of the relationships between features, and the interpretability requirements.\nLogistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are the possible candidates for ML methods to implement.\n\nInitially, the dataset undergoes a preprocessing phase to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and potentially scale numerical features. The target variable, defining crash severity, is also established during this phase. The next step involves feature selection, where the most relevant features are identified to be used in model training. Various ML models are then trained on a portion of the data, and their performance is evaluated using a separate test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to assess model performance. Based on these evaluations, the best-performing model is selected, tuned for optimal performance through hyperparameter optimization, and then validated to ensure its generalizability. Finally, the chosen model can be deployed to predict the severity of new crashes, providing valuable insights for safety measures and interventions.\n\n\n## Plan of Attack\n\n| Task Name                                     | Status       | Assignee                                          | Due        | Priority | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Develop Data Retrieval Code                  | Done         | H.M.
